When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local?

When you are going to work on more than one machine, or when you want to share your work with other people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to manually pull changes rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository, because you might only want to pull in changes when you are ready to deal with them.  For instance if you are working on a big change, you might only want to deal with your change locally.  Working from a known good state, and making small incremential commits until you have a working product. At that point you might want to pull in any any changes made since you started, merge everything together, and push your completed work back up.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are a GitHub thing are are basically the same as cloneing, except for all on GitHub.  Clones are local copies of a repository, this is where I will doing my work.  Branches are farious workflows I have inside of my clone.  I can have several branches avaliable for any reason I want.
